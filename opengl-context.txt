- Device context (DC)

	A structure that defines a set of graphic objects and their associated attributes, as well as the graphic modes that affect output
	OS requires a device context for each window on the display
	
	Device independence: draw and print output on a variety of devices; software that supports this device independence is contained in two DLL
	
		Graphics Device Interface (GDI) - "Gdi.dll"
		Device Driver - name depends on the device where the application draws output (e.g. "Vga.dll" to draw output on VGA display, "Epson9.dll" to print output on Epson FX-80 printer)
	
	Application must inform GDI to load particular device driver and to prepare the device for drawing/printing operations
	These tasks are accomplished by creating and maintaining a device context
	Warning! An application never has direct access to the DC (it operates on the structure indirectly by calling various functions)
	
	Device context layout: describe the order in which GDI objects and text are revealed (either left-to-right or right-to-left)
	
	Graphic objects
	
		Pen: line drawing; att: style, width, color; "GetDCPenColor"/"SetDCPenColor" function
		Brush: painting and filling; att: style, color, pattern, origin; "GetDCBrushColor"/"SetDCBrushColor" function
		Bitmap: copying or scrolling parts of the screen; att: size (bytes), dimensions (pixels), color-format, compression-scheme, other
		Palette: defining the set of available colors; att: colors, size (number of colors)
		Region: clipping and other operations; att: location, dimensions
		Path: painting and drawing operations; att: shape
		Font: text; att: typeface name, width, height, weight, character set, other
		
		OS automatically stores a set of default graphic objects in device context on create - Warning! There is no default bitmap or path
		"GetCurrentObject" function: retrieve specified type graphic object from a device context
		"GetObject" function: retrieve specified graphic object information (attributes)
		"SelectObject" function: replace specified graphic object in a device context
	
	Graphic modes - Warning! OS-specific
		
		Background: define how background colors are mixed with existing window or screen colors for bitmap and text operations; "GetBkMode"/"SetBkMode" function: get/set default background graphics mode
		Drawing: define how foreground colors are mixed with existing window or screen colors for pen, brush, bitmap, and text operations; "GetROP2"/"SetROP2" function
		Mapping: define how graphics output is mapped from logical (or world) space onto the window, screen, or printer paper; "GetMapMode"/"SetMapMode" function
		Polygon-fill: define how the brush pattern is used to fill the interior of complex regions; "GetPolyFillMode"/"SetPolyFillMode" function
		Stretching: define how bitmap colors are mixed with existing window or screen colors when the bitmap is compressed (or scaled down); "GetStretchBltMode"/"SetStretchBltMode" function
		
		Specify how colors are mixed, where output appears, how output is scaled, other
		OS automatically initializes a device context with default graphic modes
	
	Type
	
		Display device context: draw on video display
		
			Class device context
			
				"CS_CLASSDC" window class device-context style
				One device context to be shared by all windows in the class
				Warning! Strictly for compatibility with 16-bit Windows
			
			Common device context
			
				Not explicitly specified window class device-context style
				Maintained in a special cache (or pool) by OS
				Require release after use (because limited number and intended for shared use)
				Any changes to default data are lost after release
				Used in applications that perform infrequent drawing operations
			
			Private device context
			
				"CS_OWNDC" window class device-context style
				Private unique device context for each window in the class
				Need not to be released after used i.e. retrieve context once and then use it for all subsequent painting
				Retain any changes to default data even after release
				Used in applications that perform numerous drawing operations
				"GetDC" function
			
			Window device context
			
				Enable drawing anywhere in a window - including non-client area
				Warning! Intended for windows with custom non-client area
			
			Parent device context
			
				"CS_PARENTDC" window class device-context style
				Speed up to set up a window clipping region
				Warning! Intended for child windows only
		
		Printer device context: draw on printer (e.g. dot-matrix, ink-jet, laser) or plotter
		Memory (or compatible) device context: draw on bitmap - rather than sending output to an actual device (virtual device)
		Information device context: retrieve default device data
