- Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK)

	Write a Windows program (in C or C++).
	Headers and libraries necessary to compile and link applications.
	Cmmand-line tools for building applications (e.g. Visual C++ compiler and linker).
	Not support hardware driver development.

- Microsoft Visual Studio (VS)

	IDE for software development.
	Edit, debug, and compile code; publish applications.
	Extra features: compilers, intellisense (i.e. code completion, parameter info, quick info, member info), graphic designer.

- Windows APIs

	Most consist of either functions or Component Object Model (COM) interfaces; very few are provided as C++ classes (e.g. "GDI+" - 2D graphics API).

- Windows coding conventions

	Strange type definitions ("typedef"s) and variable names.
	
	Typedefs
	
		Windows headers contain a lot of typedefs (many of these are defined in the header file "WinDef.h").
		
		Integer type
		
			"BYTE"      (8 bits - Unsigned)
			"WORD"      (16 bits - Unsigned)
			"DWORD"     (32 bits - Unsigned)
			
			"INT32"     (32 bits - Signed)
			"INT64"     (64 bits - Signed)
			"LONG"      (32 bits - Signed)
			"LONGLONG"  (64 bits - Signed)
			
			"UINT32"    (32 bits - Unsigned)
			"UINT64"    (64 bits - Unsigned)
			"ULONG"     (32 bits - Unsigned)
			"ULONGLONG" (64 bits - Unsigned)
			
			Certain amount of redundancy (due to the history of the Windows APIs).
			Fixed size (remain the same in both 32-bit and 64-applications).
		
		Boolean type
		
			"BOOL"
			
			A type alias for "int" (i.e. an integer type); distinct from C++ "bool" (and from other Boolean type representations).
			"WinDef.h" defines two values: "FALSE" (0); "TRUE" (1) - Warning! Functions returning BOOL type can return any non-zero value to indicate Boolean truth; checking "if (result == TRUE)" (i.e. "if (result == 1)") may fail; check "if (result)" or "if (result != FALSE)" instead.
		
		Pointer type
		
			"TYPENAME* var;"  (dereference operator "*")
			"PTYPENAME var;"  (prefix "P-" or "Pointer")
			"LPTYPENAME var;" (prefix "LP-" or "Long Pointer" - a.k.a far pointer; needed on 16-bit Windows; preserved to port code to 32-bit Windows)
			
			Type of the form "pointer-to-X"
			Today no distinction (all are equivalent) - Warning! Avoid using prefixes.
		
		Pointer precision type
		
			"DWORD_PTR"
			
			"INT_PTR"
			"LONG_PTR"
			
			"UINT_PTR"
			"ULONG_PTR"
			
			Size of a pointer (i.e. 32 bits wide in 32-bit applications, and 64 bits wide in 64-bit applications); fixed, determined at compile time.
			Used where an existing 32-bit value was expanded to 64 bits on 64-bit Windows (e.g. cast an integer to a pointer, define variables for pointer arithmetic, or define loop counters (iterators) to iterate over the full range of bytes in memory buffers).
	
	Hungarian notation
	
		Add prefixes to variable names to provide additional information - Warning! Avoid using.
		
		Semantic information
		
			"i-"   ("index")
			"cb-"  ("count of bytes")
			"rw-"  ("row")
			"col-" ("column")
			
			Intended use; avoid the accidental use of a variable in the wrong context.
		
		Type information
		
			"w-"  ("WORD")
			"dw-" ("DWORD")

- Characters and strings

	Character encoding: ANSI vs. Unicode - Warning! For UI elements, file names, and so on (i.e. to localize an application).
	
		ANSI
		
			8-bit encoding
		
		Unicode (a.k.a. "wide" character)
		
			16-bit encoding (UTF-16 encoding: each character encoded as one or two 16-bit values).
			Preferred (support all character sets and languages).
	
	Literals
		
		"char a = 'a';"          (character)
		
		"char *str = "foo";"     (character string)
		
		"wchar_t a = L'a';"      (wide-character)
		
		"wchar_t *str = L"foo";" (wide-character string)
	
	Typdefs
	
		"CHAR" - "char"                          (character)
		
		"PSTR" or "LPSTR" - "char*"              (character string)
		"PCSTR" or "LPCSTR" - "const char*"
		
		"WCHAR" - "wchar_t"                      (wide-character; header file "WinNT.h")
		
		"PWSTR" or "LPWSTR" - "wchar_t*"         (wide-character string)
		"PCWSTR" or "LPCWSTR" - "const wchar_t*"
	
	Functions
	
		Two parallel sets of APIs by string:
		
			ANSI strings: suffix "-A" in function name (e.g. "functionA")
			Unicode strings: suffix "-W" in function name (e.g. "functionW")
		
		Internally, the ANSI version translates the string to Unicode at run time (i.e. less efficient).
		Most recent Windows APIs typically have just a Unicode version.
	
	Macros and preprocessor symbols
	
		Functions: Windows headers define macros to resolve by preprocessor symbol.
		
			Macro "function" resolves to function "functionW" (Unicode) if preprocessor symbol "UNICODE"; otherwise, resolves to function "functionA" (ANSI).
		
		String literals: Windows SDK provides macros that map strings to Unicode or ANSI (useful to compile the same code for either ANSI or Unicode strings), depending on the platform:
		
			"TCHAR"              resolves to "wchar_t" (Unicode) if "UNICODE"; otherwise, resolves to "char"  (ANSI)
			"TEXT()" (or "_T()") resolves to "L"foo""  (Unicode) if "UNICODE"; otherwise, resolves to ""foo"" (ANSI)
		
		Some headers use preprocessor symbol "UNICODE", others "_UNICODE" - Warning! Define always both symbols (Visual C++ sets them both by default when create a new project).

- Handles

	A number the OS uses to identify an object - Warning! Not a pointer (error on attemp to dereference)
	Opaque data type (i.e. fully encapsulated - unknown internals - user-defined/built-in data type)
	Handlers (and correponding objects) are created and operated (handler as a parameter) through functions

- Window

	Programming construct (central to Windows OS - hence its name):
	
		Occupy certain portion of the screen
		May or not be visible
		Know how to draw itself
		Respond to user or OS events
	
	Type - by importance
	
		Application/Main window
		
			Non-client area: the frame (title bar, maximize/minimize buttons); managed by the OS
			Client area: the area within the frame (other standard UI elements); managed by the program
		
		UI Control window: does not exist by itself - relative to application window (e.g. move together, notify events)
	
	Type - by role
	
		Parent window: contain - clipped ot boders - other (child) windows e.g. application window (parent) and UI control window (child)
		Owner window: own other (owned) windows e.g. application window (owner) and modal dialog window (owned)
	
	Handle
	
		Windows are objects referenced by a handler - Warning! Not a C++ class
		Data type: "HWND" (Handler Window)
	
	Functions
	
		Create: "CreateWindow", "CreateWindowEx"
		Operate: "MoveWindow"
	
	Coordinates
	
		Unit of length: device-independent pixel (DIP/DP)
		
		Type - by space
		
			Warning! Origin (0,0) is always top-left corner of corresponding region
			
			Screen coordinates: relative to the screen
			Window coordinates: relative to a window (frame included)
			Client coordinates: relative to a window client area

- "WinMain" application entry point 

	Windows entry-point function
	
		"WinMain" (ANSI)
		
			"int WINAPI WinMain(HINSTANCE hInstance, HINSTANCE hPrevInstance, PSTR lpCmdLine, int nCmdShow);"
			
			"hInstance": handle to an instance or to a module
			"hPrevInstance": no meaning (used in 16-bit Windows); now always 0
			"lpCmdLine": command-line arguments as ANSI string
			"nCmdShow": flag to indicate how main application window is shown (minimized, maximized, normal)
			
			"int": retval (i.e. return value) type; OS not use it (can be passed as a status code to other program)
			"WINAPI": calling convention; specify how arguments to function are placed (order) and managed on the stack	
		
		"wWinMain" (Unicode - preferred)
		
			"int WINAPI wWinMain(HINSTANCE hInstance, HINSTANCE hPrevInstance, PWSTR pCmdLine, int nCmdShow);"
			
			"pCmdLine": command-line arguments as Unicode string
	
	Utils
	
		"GetCommandLine": get Unicode copy of command-line arguments
		"CommandLiveToArgvW": convert command-line arguments into argv-style array
	
	Microsoft C runtime library (CRT)
	
		Provide an implementation of "main" that calls either "WinMain" or "wWinMain"
		Some more work inside "main" (e.g. call any static initializers before "wWinMain")
